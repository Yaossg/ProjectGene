# ProjectGene

## Overview

Hybrid your animals and find the best among them! Currently giving classical 4 animals (sheep, cow, chicken, pig) some gene types, following Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment, also paying attention to gene mutation!

Each and every gene matters! Most of which contributes to its look and loot. Unlike with Forestry you hold some item-like bees in the hand or put some blocky trees on the ground, there are ***real*** livings to breed and feed in this world!

## Additional Features

- Rainbow sheep are no longer a look. Depending on specific genes instead of name, rainbow sheep drop different wools
- Merge cows and mooshroom by different gene types. Cows also eat grass and mushroom sheared also grow back.
- Mixed type of mooshroom growing both red and brown mushroom, even with a flower! 
- Saddle of a pig can be taken down by shearing.
- Some staff and potion to control animals' behaviors like growth and sex. Particularly you can let them selfing.
- Some easter eggs hidden.

## Current Status

| Animals | Status        |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Sheep   | Well-designed |
| Cow     | Well-designed |
| Chicken | Plain         |
| Pig     | Plain?        |



## Future Development

Better textures especially for mixed type of mooshroom

More animals and more gene types.

More special rewards and features.

Develop a way to anylze and modify genes
